# Unconditionally Universal Speeches

People speak a lot.

For example: politicians when they hold a speech.

Playing with the linguistic concept of **Language Universals**, I wrote some code that weeds through speeches, taking out everything except nouns and verbs.
Reading it in the aftermath allows the reader a maybe pensive, maybe revealing, but most probably just ten-seconds-fun-amusing, 
digest of some past US president's mumblings.

Hope you'll enjoy : )

## To Run

Put on some shoes and go outside. Move feet swiftly.

## To Run the code

- either follow along my steps inside the `unconditionally.ipynb` file (You'll need to have Jupyter Notebooks for that)
- or use just the python file `unconditionally.py`

Both require a Python 3 environment.

Simply enter the name of one of the `state_union` speeches into the `get_real()` function. Press what you need to press. Open `index.html`. ðŸŽ‰
